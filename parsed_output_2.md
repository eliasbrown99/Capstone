# 15. SUPERVISORY CONTROLS

All BPA Holder employees shall work under the direct supervision of the BPA Holder's Program Manager (PM). The BPA COR or designee in the local organizational office being supported will provide general oral or written guidance and the overall objectives of the work to be performed to the PM and establish priorities. The BPA Holder is fully responsible for all supervisory functions related to the staff provided.

# 16. ORGANZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND LIMITATION ON FUTURE CONTRACTING

It is anticipated that contractor personnel performing work under this BPA will receive, have access to, or participate in the development of proprietary or source selection information (e.g., cost or pricing information, budget information or analyses, specifications, or work statements, etc.), or perform evaluation services which may create a current or subsequent Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5. Therefore, the Contractor is expressly prohibited from competing on all related work during the performance of the BPA and for a period of three (3) years from the end date of this BPA as a prime contractor, subcontractor, or consultant.

# 17. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE

All work hereunder shall be subject to review by the Government. The COR is responsible for inspection and acceptance of all incoming shipments, documents, and services. Acceptance of the final deliverables shall be made in writing by the COR.

# 18. NON-PERSONAL SERVICES

This is a non-personal services agreement as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation 37.101, under which the services performed by the BPA Holder are rendered in its capacity as an independent BPA Holder. The Government will evaluate the quality of the services provided but retains no control over the BPA Holder's employees or agents. The BPA Holder is solely liable for, and expressly agrees to indemnify the Government with respect to any liability producing acts or omissions by it or by its employees or agents.

# 19. RESTRICTIONS AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT

The BPA Holder and its employees shall conduct business covered only by the Orders during periods paid for by the Government and shall not conduct any other business on Government premises. During all operations on Government premises, the Contractor shall comply with the rules, regulations, and procedures governing the conduct of personnel and the safe, secure, and effective operation of the facility, as expressed in written, oral, and logical procedures.

# 20. BPA HOLDER PERSONNEL IDENTIFICATION (APPLICABLE TO ANY WORK PERFORMED ON-SITE AT USDOT)

A BPA Holder requesting an initial or renewal identification (ID) badge must complete the Identification Card/Credential Application (DOT F1681). The BPA Holder who may have access to USDOT facilities, sensitive information, the USDOT Information Technology Systems, and/or resources must complete the Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF- 85P) form. Copies of these forms will be provided to the BPA Holder at award. The only exception to completing and submitting the SF-85P will be for those BPA staff members serving on a contract for less than 120 days, and BPA staff members who already

## Page 23 of 44

693JJ325Q000011

have completed background investigations. BPA staff members who will work on-site for less than 120 days will be subject to a fingerprint check. If the BPA staff member's position is extended beyond 120 days, however, he or she will be required to complete the SF-85P, which is the office form required to initiate background investigations.

To obtain an initial identification badge, BPA staff member must submit the completed SF-85P, and the DOT F1681 signed by the appropriate COR. A staff member from the DOT will serve as authorizing official for identification badges. New BPA staff members should bring both forms to HR for review and authorization prior to being photographed for a badge.

The HR Staff checks to see if the BPA staff member has a completed investigation. If an investigation can be verified, the DOT F1681 is authorized by HR Staff. The BPA staff member can then proceed to the USDOT Office of the Secretary (OST) Security Processing Office to obtain a new ID.

If the HR Staff cannot verify an investigation, they will contact the OST Security Processing Office so that they can query additional records to find the information. In the event the Security Office cannot verify the investigation, the BPA staff member will have to complete a new SF-85P and be fingerprinted prior to HR Staff signing the DOT F1681. Once the necessary paperwork is completed, BPA staff member can proceed to the OST Security Processing Office to receive new photo identification.

**NOTE**: BPA Holders will not be allowed to obtain or renew identification badges unless they have had a suitability investigation. BPA Holder personnel will not be granted access to USDOT Information Technology Systems until they have obtained an identification badge.

# 21. PHYSICAL SECURITY

The Contractor shall be responsible for safeguarding all government equipment, information, and property provided for Contractor use. At the close of each work period, government facilities, equipment, and materials shall be secured.

# 22. DISSEMINATION OF CONTRACT INFORMATION

The Contractor shall not publish, permit to be published, or distribute for public consumption, any information, oral or written, concerning the results or conclusions made pursuant to the performance under this BPA and the task orders issued hereunder, without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer. Two copies of any material proposed to be published or distributed shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer and one copy to the Contracting Officer's Representative.

# 23. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SUPPORT AND DISCLAIMER

An acknowledgment of USDOT support and a disclaimer must appear in any publication of any material, whether copyrighted or not, based on or developed under this BPA in the following terms:

"This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Transportation under order number TBD##."

Additionally, all materials must contain the following statement:

"Any opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. Department of Transportation.". The FHWA CO, BPA COR, or BPA Order TOCOR may direct the Contractor to add alternative disclaimer language, depending on deliverable content.

693JJ325Q000011

# 24. IDENTIFICATION OF BPA HOLDER EMPLOYEES

All BPA Holder personnel attendings, answering Government telephones, and working in other situations where their BPA Holder status is not obvious to third parties, are required to identify themselves as such to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the public that they are Government officials. They must also ensure that all documents or reports produced by the BPA Holder are suitably marked as FHWA products and that BPA Holder participation is appropriately disclosed.

# 25. CONTRACTOR'S FAILURE TO PERFORM REQUIRED SERVICES

The rights of the Government and remedies described in this section are in addition to all other rights and remedies set forth in the contract. Specifically, the Government reserves its rights under the Inspection of Services and Termination Clauses. Any reductions in the Contractor's invoice shall reflect the contract's reduced value resulting from the Contractor's failure to perform required services. The Contractor shall not be relieved of full performance of the services hereunder and may be terminated for default based upon inadequate performance of services, even if a reduction was previously taken for any inadequate performance.

# 26. POST-AWARD EVALUATION OF BPA HOLDER PERFORMANCE

- (a) Interim and final evaluations of contractor performance will be prepared on the BPA orders in accordance with FAR 42.1502 and TAM 1242.1502. The final performance evaluations will be prepared at the time of completion of work.
- (b) The Contractor can elect to review the evaluation and submit additional information or a rebuttal statement. The Contractor will be permitted 60 calendar days to respond. Contractor response is voluntary. If the Contractor does not respond within 60 days, the Government will presume that the contractor has no comment. Any disagreement between the parties regarding an evaluation will be referred to an individual at a level above the CO, whose decision is final.
- (c) Copies of the evaluations, contractor responses, and review comments, if any, will be retained as part of the BPA file, and may be used to support future award decisions.

The Federal Highway Administration utilizes the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to record and maintain past performance information. CPARS is used to document contractor performance information that is required by Federal Regulations.

CPARS reference material can be accessed at http://www.cpars.gov/.

The registration process requires the contractor to identify an individual that will serve as a primary contact. This individual will be authorized access to the evaluation for review and comment. In addition, the Contractor is encouraged to identify a secondary contact in the event the primary contact is unavailable to process the evaluation within the required 60-day time period. After the FHWA Contract Specialist registers the BPA order in CPARS, the Contractor will receive a system generated e-mail notifying him/her that the BPA order is registered. A system generated e-mail will also provide the contractor with a User ID if the person does not already have a CPARS User ID.

Once a performance evaluation has been prepared and is ready for comment, the Contractor representative will receive a system generated e-mail notification that the performance evaluation is electronically available for review and comment. The contractor representative will receive an automated

# Page 25 of 44

693JJ325Q000011

e-mail whenever an assessment is completed and can subsequently retrieve the completed assessment from CPARS

Contractors may access evaluations at http://www.cpars.gov/ for review and comment in CPARS.

# 27. TELEWORKING

The BPA Holder's personnel performing work on-site may telework in the event of closure of the Government's office(s), or by prior approval of the COR and/or TOCOR. Each BPA Holder must have a telework policy in place and a signed telework agreement for each BPA Holder personnel. The signed telework agreement shall be retained by the BPA Holder and provided to the BPA COR and BPA Order TOCOR.

- (b) To the extent that the work under this Blanket Purchase Agreement and resultant Orders requires access to proprietary, business confidential, or financial data of other companies, and provided such data is marked โProprietary and Confidential,โ the Contractor shall protect such information from unauthorized use and disclosure and agrees not to use it to compete against such companies.
- (c) For these purposes, โProprietary and Confidentialโ information shall mean any information reasonably so designated that is not generally available to the public; but not information that becomes available on a nonconfidential basis from another source, or was known to Contractor on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to Contractor in the performance of this Blanket Purchase Agreement and resultant Orders.
- (d) The Contractor shall include the substance of this confidentiality agreement in all subcontracts and Consultant agreements for performance of work under this Blanket Purchase Agreement and resultant Orders unless excused in writing by the CO.

Closure or delays of this nature during the performance period do not entitle the Contractor to additional compensation or to an automatic period of performance extension.

## 34. CLOSEOUT OF THE BPA AND ORDERS

The Government will initiate the administrative closeout of Orders after receiving evidence that all technical requirements have been completed. The BPA Holder shall furnish all required documents in support of the closeout of this BPA and Orders.

## QUOTATION INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUATION

### 36. CONTENTS OF QUOTATIONS:

Quotations are requested under two phases for this RFQ. The Phase I quotation submission will consist of Volume I - Phase I Technical Quotation. The Phase II quotation submission will include Volume II - Phase II Technical Quotation and Volume III - Phase II Business Quotation. The technical quotations shall not include any cost or pricing information.

Note to Offeror: One or more aspects of an Offeror's quotation may be incorporated into the BPA award resulting from this RFQ.

After the Government completes evaluation Volume I, offerors will receive an advisory notification via e-mail from the CO. This notification will advise the Offeror of the Government's advisory recommendation to proceed or not to proceed with Phase II submission.

Offerors who are rated most highly for their Volume I submission will be advised to proceed to Phase II of the quotation submission process. Offerors who were not among the most highly rated will be advised that they are unlikely to be viable competitors, along with the general basis for the Government's advisory recommendation.

The intent of this advice is to minimize proposal development costs for those offerors with a low likelihood of receiving an award. The Government intends to provide no more than ten (10) offerors with an advisory notification to proceed. However, the Government's advice will be a recommendation only, and those offerors who are advised not to proceed may elect to continue their participation in the procurement. The Government does not intend to provide additional feedback beyond the advisory notifications until after awards have been issued from this solicitation. Failure to participate in Phase I of the procurement precludes further consideration of an offeror. Offeror submissions will not be accepted from Offerors who have not submitted Phase I quotations by the due date and time stated in this RFQ.

The Contracting Officer will include the Phase II submission instructions on the advisory notice to all offerors.

Quotation volumes shall be organized and divided by the following sections:

## EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

The following evaluation phases and evaluation factors will be used for this procurement.

Phase I:

- Factor 1 โ Technical Approach (Part 1)
- Factor 2 โ Corporate Experience

## Page 42 of 44

693JJ325Q000011

# Phase II

- Factor 3 โ Technical Approach (Part 2)
- Factor 4 โ Management Approach
- Factor 5 โ Price

# Phase I Factors:

## Factor 1 - Technical Approach

The Government will evaluate each Offeror's quotation response to the requirements based on the degree of clarity, detail, effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and relevancy and the benefits of its Technical Approach, taking into consideration the following points:

- The Offerorโs demonstrated understanding of the scope and objectives of the technical requirements, and the Offerorโs demonstrated technical knowledge and ability to meet the technical requirements of the SOW and provide the Government innovation.
- The approach and strategy for cost effectively enhancing and incrementally improving technologies utilized in the systems to add business value.

## Factor 2 โ Corporate Experience

The Government will evaluate and assess whether the Offeror will successfully perform work under the BPA through the evaluation of examples of recent and relevant corporate experience providing services similar in size and complexity to the requirements of the solicitation. "Recent" is defined as relevant experience performed anytime within three (3) years from the date of the issuance of this RFQ. "Relevant" experience is defined as experience where the Offeror has performed the same or similar work covered by this BPA for federal agencies, including similar degree of comparability, technical complexity, and technical scope. Offerors should provide at least two (2) but no more than five (5) examples of corporate experience as the prime Contractor.

# Phase II Factors

## Factor 3 โ Technical Approach

The Government will evaluate each Offeror's quotation response to the requirements based on the degree of clarity, detail, effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and relevancy and the benefits of its Technical Approach, taking into consideration the following points:

- The Offerorโs demonstrated understanding of the scope and objectives of the technical requirements, and the Offerorโs demonstrated technical knowledge and ability to meet the technical requirements of the SOW and provide the Government innovation.
- The approach and strategy for cost effectively enhancing and incrementally improving technologies utilized in the systems to add business value.
- The benefit of the Offerorโs proposed performance standards to allow the Government to track cost, schedule, and planned versus actual.

# Page 43 of 44

693JJ325Q000011

## Factor 4 โ Management Approach

The Government will evaluate each offeror's proposed management approach (including the Transition-In Plan), taking into consideration the following points:

- The Offerorโs approach and strategy for staffing the requirement to realize an efficient and effective use of personnel to include the appropriateness of the quoted labor categories, mix of labor and skill levels, including vetting of potential candidates to meet technical and security requirements to facilitate a seamless onboarding process. The Government will also evaluate the Offerorโs quoted Key Personnel to make sure they meet the requirements outlined in Section 4.0 of the SOW.
- The Offerorโs approach and strategy for keeping staff trained in emerging technologies and product releases and for ensuring that high-quality, well-trained personnel are hired and retained for all tasks.

## Factor 5 โ Price

The Government will evaluate each BPA Offerorโs BPA Labor Categories and Labor Rates, and all quoted prices to determine if the pricing reflects a clear understanding of the requirements, is consistent with the methods of performance described in the BPA Offerorโs technical approach, and if any discount is offered against the MAS contract pricing.

To evaluate prices for award purposes, the Government will apply the BPA Offeror's fully burdened, fixed hourly quoted labor rates to the Government's estimated quantities of use over the life of the BPA, as estimated in the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The IGCE will not be disclosed to the public. Price will be evaluated with respect to the IGCE expected use of skills multiplied by the hourly pricing quoted for each labor category in years one through six of Attachment 1 - Schedule of Labor Rates.

## 38. BASIS FOR AWARD

In Phase I of the evaluation, the Government will evaluate quotes based upon Factor 1 - Technical Approach and Factor 2 - Corporate Experience. As part of evaluation, the Government intends to issue an advisory notification after Phase I of the quote evaluations. In the advisory notification, offerors whose quote was not among the most highly rated will receive an advisory notification that it is unlikely that their quote will be accepted, and that the Government does not recommend that they submit a Phase II quote. Offerors are not prohibited from submitting a Phase II quote based upon the Government's advisory notice. In Phase II of the evaluation, the Government will evaluate quotes based upon Factor 3 - Technical Approach, Factor 4 - Management Approach, and Factor 5 - Price.

After Phase II of the evaluation, the basis for award will utilize a best-value decision developed from a trade-off analysis, considering the evaluation of factors from both Phase I and Phase II. For the trade-off analysis, the Technical Approach (Factor 1 and Factor 3), Management Approach, and Corporate Experience will be utilized as the technical/non-price related factors in the analysis and are listed above in descending order of importance. All non-price factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than Price. If two or more quotations are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e., are technically equivalent), an award may be made to the lower-priced quotations. However, award may also be made to other than the lowest priced quotations if the Government determines that a higher price is warranted due to technical merit denoted in the evaluation. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotations, if the Government determines that a higher price is not the best value.

# Page 44 of 44

The Government reserves the right to enter into exchanges with all offerors, if it is in the best interest of the Government; however, the Government anticipates selecting the best-suited quotes from the initial quotes, without engaging in exchanges with all Offerors.
